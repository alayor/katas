Each time Sunny and Johnny take a trip to the Ice Cream Parlor, 
they pool together _m_ dollars for ice cream. 
On any given day, the parlor offers a line of _n_ flavors. 
Each flavor _i_ is numbered sequentially with a unique ID number from to 
and has a cost associated with it.

Given the value of _m_ and the cost of each flavor for _t_ trips to the 
Ice Cream Parlor, help Sunny and Johnny choose two flavors such that 
they spend their entire pool of money (_m_) during each visit. 
For each trip to the parlor, print the ID numbers for the two types 
of ice cream that Sunny and Johnny purchase as two space-separated 
integers on a new line. You must print the smaller ID first and the 
larger ID second.
